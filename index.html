    <p>Not the right result? The bot can get the wrong answer for various reasons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Bad Timestamp:</b> By default, the bot checks the middle of your video. You can try again with a specific time to tell it to check like "@watsongisthis 0:14"</li>
      <li><b>Unpublished song:</b> My bot can't find anything that hasn't yet been published, like any underground artist's music.</li>
      <li><b>Samples:</b> If the bot looks at a less than ideal point in the song, it may accidentally find the original song that your song sampled. Conversely, someone might have sampled the song you are looking for, and that can end up being the result. Try a different timestamp.</li>
      <li><b>Too much noise:</b> If there's too much background noise, or even two songs are playing at the same time, it could affect the song result.</li>
    </ul>
